      <h1>About Abu Aaisha</h1>
      <p>I'm striving to be a practicing Muslim, walking in the footsteps of our rightly guided predecessors (Salaf). Growing up in the 90s, I deeply cherish the life we had back then – a life rich with social interactions and genuinely amicable relationships among neighbors and relatives.

I often reflect on how teenagers in those days spent countless hours reading books and playing in fields every afternoon; I believe this played a crucial role in raising truly resilient kids. If we could revive even a semblance of that way of life today, it would significantly impact today's youth, helping them break free from the overwhelming internet frenzy and the isolation of virtual existence.

My write-ups, written in both Bangla and English, primarily aim to pinpoint the challenges faced by Muslims in today's world and offer potential solutions. If you find benefit in what you read here, please consider leaving a comment. I'd love to connect and hear your thoughts.</p>
