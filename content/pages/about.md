I'm striving to be a practicing Muslim, walking in the footsteps of our rightly guided predecessors (Salaf). Growing up in the 90s, I deeply cherish the life we had back then â€“ a life rich with social interactions and genuinely amicable relationships among neighbors and relatives. I often reflect on how teenagers in those days spent countless hours reading books and playing in fields every afternoon; I believe this played a crucial role in raising truly resilient kids. If we could revive even a semblance of that way of life today, it would significantly impact today's youth, helping them break free from the overwhelming internet frenzy and the isolation of virtual existence. My write-ups, written in both Bangla and English, primarily aim to pinpoint the challenges faced by Muslims in today's world and offer potential solutions.
